# Resurrect RFCs

## Summary

Resurrect the RFC process for discussing and iterating on technology-related processes within Made Tech.

## Problem

RFCs allow for asynchronous discussions around technology-related process improvement at Made Tech. Other mediums such as Slack conversations and/or the weekly Technology COP 4 pm meetup don't provide the opportunity for everyone to contribute that would like to; Slack threads can be missed or overlooked, and other commitments sometimes prevent us from joining the COP.

RFCs have historically been open to all teams and areas within the business.

## Proposal

I'm reluctant to provide a concrete proposal or action but would ideally prefer to open this to a discussion that isn't on Slack or similar. 

With the discussion that follows, we could update this proposal section with a version that has a consensus that can then be voted on.

Some initial ideas on discussion points:

- Are RFCs valuable to discussing and iterating on technology process improvements at Made Tech?
- Are RFCs valuable still outside of the technology team?
- Are RFCs easy to read and understand when a decision has been made in the original form?
- Could we use a [Playbook-esque](https://docusaurus.io/) site that is shaped by RFCs to better consume agreed processes?
