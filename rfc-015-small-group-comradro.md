# Organise Small Group Comradros

## Summary

Propose and join fortnightly small group retrospectives/workshops/discussions/other on topics of your choosing.

## Problem

There is no organisation currently about how Small Group Comradros should be organised, by who, how to join them, where to keep track of them, and when they should be run.

## Proposal

Anyone interested in proposing a Small Group Comradro **MUST** post their idea as a ticket in the Upcoming column of [the Trello Board][sgc-trello] by lunchtime Friday on a Comradro week, assigning themselves to it.

Anyone interested in joining a Small Group Comradro **SHOULD** assign themselves to **ONE** proposal they're interested in by lunchtime Friday on a Comradro week.

Proposals **MUST** be made public, to give people the opportunity to join. For example on Slack, and mentioned at QT and Learn Tech.

Anyone who has proposed or joined a Small Group Comradro **SHOULD** break at 3:30PM on a Comradro week to join, and **MUST** return at 4:30PM.

Anyone involved in a Small Group Comradro **MAY** present action points or output of their discussion to the wider team at 4:30PM, at the same time as Learn Tech showcases and sticker awards.
