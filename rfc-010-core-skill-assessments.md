# Core Skill Assessments

## Summary

Decide who is justified to determine somebody's achievement of a core skill badge.

## Problem

We recently started core skill tests with a TDD curriculum of three badges. The curriculum was primarily developed by Adrian, Craig and Richard, with contributions by other developers and directors. After Adrian, Craig and Richard began invigilating these tests, there was concern amongst the team over the rules of who may invigilate.

- Who should be able to invigilate a test?
- What criteria is necessary for somebody to have this privilege?
- How can we ensure that assessment is fairly given?
- If we involve invigilators who did not write curriculum, how can we ensure they understand the marking scheme enough to fairly assess others?
- What are the rules???

## Proposal

1. Marking schemes and curriculum designed **MUST** be publicly distributed amongst all team members who may want to be assessed for the core skill before assessments start. Any team member **MAY** question or criticise the material, and their feedback **MUST** be considered before starting assessments. Time should be given for this feedback. This prevents course leaders from assessing prematurely, if the team feels the material needs work.

2. Team members who _create_ course curriculum and marking schemes should be considered able to invigilate assessments in that subject, irregardless of whether they have earned the badge themselves yet. It is expected that people who have written the material are able to judge achievement of it. This also prevents us from being blocked from running any assessments.

3. Team members who have _earned_ a badge should be considered able to invigilate assessments for that badge. This opens up resource, to prevent the number of course leaders from being a bottleneck.

4. The marking scheme **MUST** be written in such a way as to be as unambiguous as possible, so it 
feasible for anybody who did not write the scheme, but has achieved the badge, to invigilate for that badge fairly. This reduces the risk of people attributing marks which may not accurately reflect the intention behind the marking scheme.
