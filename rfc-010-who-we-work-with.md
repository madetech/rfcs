# Discussion: Who we work with

## Summary

How much do we care about which companies/organisations we work with?

## Problem

I have concerns about working with certain companies, and want to see how other people at Made feel about it.

If we don't have this conversation, we might end up working in a way that doesn't reflect our shared values, because we all assumed it was just us with those concerns.

The intent of this RFC is to gather that understanding, **not** to jump ahead and propose any restrictions on who we work with.

## Proposal

A discussion, against this PR - are there companies that you wouldn't want to work with? How strongly do you feel about that?

Please bear in mind this could be a sensitive topic. I don't want to see anyone trying to shame other people because of personal ethics.

No-one should feel obliged to participate, but if you have a neutral opinion on this ("I'm happy for us to work with anyone"), it would be good to hear from you. Having thoughts from only people who feel strongly might give a false picture of how we feel as a group.
