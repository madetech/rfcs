# Adopt Harvest timesheets for delivery and live services

## Summary

Expect delivery and live service team members to fill in a weekly timesheet. These timesheets will be used to calculate our weekly billings for our customers and track our budgets more effectively.  

## Problem

Every team currently calculates billings in their own way. Live services use Harvest, our delivery teams create custom spreadsheets for each project. The fragmentation in approach makes it difficult to  understand things like utilisation rate and how much budget we have remaining on a PO. 

## Proposal

Delivery and live service team members to commit to filling in a timesheet each week. Reminders will be sent out at 4pm on Friday.
