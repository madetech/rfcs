# Pull Request Standards

## Summary

A checklist designed to help facilitate code reviews by outlining a pre-review checklist to follow for the raiser of the pull request, and a reviewer checklist.

## Problem

Pull requests follow no set format and vary between projects, which in turn causes reviews to take longer and require more context switching. Code review and commentary often happens 'offline', which results in reduced context and fewer points of reference when reviewing changes later.

## Proposal

Before raising a pull request, consider this checklist:

 - [ ] Pull request description outlines _what has changed_
 - [ ] Pull request description outlines _why the change was made_
 - [ ] If the project has a linter, it SHOULD not report any issues with the pull request
 - [ ] Code follows project specific coding conventions
 - [ ] Code follows language specific conventions in the absence of a project specific convention
 - [ ] Code has been refactored with quality and readability in mind
 - [ ] Tests are obviously the product of practising TDD (where appropriate)
 - [ ] There are high level feature/acceptance tests in place as appropriate
 - [ ] Tests have been refactored - aim for quality, readability and maintainability
 - [ ] Test suite shows that the change has been tested to adequate confidence.

When reviewing a pull request, consider this checklist:

 - [ ] Does the code achieve the goal outlined in _why the change was made_?
 - [ ] Could the change have been implemented using a different strategy that would be a credible alternative? If so, why would the alternative be better?
 - [ ] Does the code follow all of the testing and standards requirements in the pre-review checklist?
 - [ ] Does the code introduce unnecessary additional complexity or lengthy test cycles?
 - [ ] Could I suggest changes that would make the code more readable?
 - [ ] Could I suggest changes that would make the code more maintainable?
 - [ ] Are there any gaps or potential issues to be found in the testing strategy? Are the tests _sane_?
 - [ ] Do your review comments follow standard outlined in [rfc-007](rfc-007-code-review-comments.md)?

Universal Pull Request Checklist:

- [ ] Before merging, summarise any offline discussion of review comments (why a change may or may not be implemented) to aid future reference
- [ ] SHOULD avoid branching from branches, branch from origin/master where possible
- [ ] SUGGEST commit history can be rebased into meaningful commits
- [ ] SUGGEST if commit history is too large to rebase into a single commit, multiple pull requests may be desirable
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive, accurate and spell-checked. See [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- [ ] It is the author of the pull request's responsibility to merge the pull request
- [ ] Pull requests MUST have approval of at least one reviewer before merging
- [ ] After merging, delete the branch
