**Introducing a Company Communications Calendar**


As we’ve grown we’ve seen an increase in Slack updates from all areas of the business and it’s getting really noisy, easy to miss out or lose track of communications.

Many of us have started sending a Slack message and Emails about the same thing to ensure we reach you all which helps, especially if you were on holiday.

There are various levels of importance and audiences that are impacted with communication and we want to organise this information better so you can absorb it more easily. 


**How?**
We’ve created a first version of a communications calendar to help organise when and how we send out information to team members that are in the 3 categories below:

**People Impacting Announcements**
Comms from Service Areas or Leadership that are about things like: pay, rewards, org structure, questions from team to Leadership (leadership-questions channel)
Frequency: Monthly slot

**General Announcements**
Comms from teams about things like: new clients, winning awards, PR, Marketing, new initiatives 
Frequency: Fortnightly slots

#**Updates & Initiatives** 
Comms from team members about things like: capabilities work, existing projects/clients, existing initiatives (i.e. podcast, social events), upcoming events
Frequency: Two slots per week

#**Audience:**
All Company
Market
Group (i.e. all internal teams)
Large group (i.e. technology roles)

**How does this impact me?**
As a sender/owner of comms that fits into the 3 categories above you will now have to book in a time and method to send out your comms. 
Trello: A backlog can be found and added to the ['Company Comms 2022'](https://trello.com/b/d2QmZW2e/company-comms-2022) board.
 - Your Community Managers can talk you through the process.

Team members who want specific updates or have questions for leadership please continue to use the #leadership-questions Slack channel. We also have a team requested comms backlog list on Trello you can add to. 


All other communication, such as Showcases and specific channel (i.e. x-wellbeing) or audience (direct email/slack to small group of people) can continue as they are. 

You can continue to share news with the team via the #common-room channel, however we want to schedule announcements that people need to know about effectively.
